# graph_comparison
Incomplete. TODO/Original plan: Show graph search algorithms performance differences. 
Implemented: 
1. A-star algorithm searching from purple to pink blocks. 
2. Can move both blocks by dragging them into other spots. 
3. Dragging on empty spots will create walls. 
4. Clicking Find path! will find the shortest path using A-start from purple to pink;
